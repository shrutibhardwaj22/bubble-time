## 💡 Why I Built This

I was struggling to stay focused while studying. Every time I picked up my phone to check how much time had passed, I would get distracted and end up scrolling instead of studying.

That’s when I realized I needed a **dedicated focus timer on my laptop** — something simple, motivating, and always visible. So, I built **Focus Bubble** to help me stay on track and beat distractions.
